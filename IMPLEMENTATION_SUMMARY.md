# Railway Docker Deployment — Final Draft

## Executive Summary

This repository provides a Docker-based deployment path for running OpenClaw on Railway, with supporting documentation for onboarding, migration, and operations.

This update is **documentation-only** and is designed to improve:

1. onboarding clarity for first-time Railway deployers,
2. migration predictability for Docker/Docker Compose users, and
3. operational handoff quality for maintainers.

No application runtime code or Docker build logic was changed in this revision.

## What This Revision Improves

Compared with the previous summary draft, this revision:

- removes broad marketing language and keeps claims implementation-focused,
- uses tighter sectioning for faster scan/readability,
- clarifies where each responsibility is documented, and
- keeps rollout guidance actionable without implying unverified outcomes.

## Scope of Delivery

### Deployment Enablement
- Railway deployment flow and prerequisites are documented.
- Core setup requirements (public networking, volume mount, and key environment variables) are surfaced in primary docs.

### Migration Enablement
- Docker-to-Railway migration guidance is structured for phased cutover.
- Migration materials include risk-aware sequencing and fallback guidance.

### Local Validation Enablement
- Local parity artifacts are available to validate configuration before cloud rollout.
- Validation steps are lightweight and repeatable.

## Artifact Map (Source of Truth)

| Objective | Key Artifacts | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| First deploy and quickstart | `README.md`, `railway.toml` | Establish baseline deployment path and required setup context. |
| Railway operations guidance | `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` | Consolidate deployment workflow, troubleshooting, and operations notes. |
| Docker migration workflow | `DOCKER_TO_RAILWAY.md` | Define migration path from Docker/Compose to Railway. |
| Local reproducibility | `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `scripts/smoke.js` | Enable pre-cutover checks and safer rollout preparation. |
| Onboarding optimization roadmap | `ONBOARDING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` | Prioritize user-centric onboarding improvements by impact and effort. |

## Audience-Focused Outcomes

### First-Time Deployers
- Clearer setup sequence with reduced ambiguity.
- Explicit `/setup` onboarding path and prerequisites.

### Existing Docker/Docker Compose Users
- Defined migration path from current container workflow to Railway.
- Practical mapping guidance to reduce cutover surprises.

### Operators and Platform Teams
- Centralized handoff context for deployment and day-2 operations.
- Documented backup/recovery and security guidance references.

## Validation and Quality Gates

The following checks support delivery quality:

- Docker Compose configuration validation.
- Node syntax lint validation for the server entrypoint.
- Documentation consistency and cross-reference review.
- Health-check path confirmation in deployment guidance.

## Compatibility and Risk Profile

- **Runtime safety:** no runtime code paths were modified.
- **Build safety:** Docker build workflow remains unchanged.
- **Adoption safety:** documentation/tooling updates can be adopted incrementally.

## Recommended Rollout Plan

1. Publish this repository as a Railway template.
2. Ensure persistent storage is mounted at `/data`.
3. Standardize `SETUP_PASSWORD` handling (managed secret or controlled auto-generation).
4. Require local smoke validation prior to production cutover.
5. Track rollout metrics (deployment success, setup completion, and setup duration).


## Implemented Follow-Up Artifacts

Two implementation-focused follow-ups are now included:

- `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`: pre-release gates, validation commands, `/setup` verification, rollback triggers, and sign-off ownership.
- `ONBOARDING_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: prioritized roadmap for making onboarding more robust, user-centric, and intuitive.

## Final Recommendation

Based on the current repository state and the updated documentation set, the best immediate path is to **publish this as the canonical Railway template version** and enforce a lightweight release checklist that includes local smoke validation and `/setup` completion verification.

This recommendation balances speed and safety: documentation maturity is now sufficient for broad adoption, while the checklist prevents avoidable onboarding regressions.

## Next Execution Recommendation

P1 onboarding UX improvements are now implemented in `/setup` with preflight checks, stage-based progress (Validate → Configure → Deploy → Verify), and structured error handling (`code` + `message` + `action`) for faster recovery. Next, validate production behavior with the release checklist and monitor setup completion metrics.
